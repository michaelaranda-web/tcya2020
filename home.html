          <h3>Is there a registration fee?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
            There is no registration fee! Simply register 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWLsh3XNN0k8tfgwSkXeLuSqWQslDwvp7VVLKUuVKLu24Q1g/viewform?usp=sf_link">

          <h3>If I am not on the West Coast, can I still participate?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
            Yes, everyone is welcome to participate in this year's online conference. The conference schedule 
            is probably most convenient for those on the West Coast, but the schedule does include breaks during which  
            attendees who want to have lunch and dinner at times that are more convenient for them can do so.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>How do I connect to the conference?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
            We will be using Zoom conference calls to host this year's TCYA Leadership Conference. More details to come on how to connect.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Who is the conference for?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
            The conference program is tailored to high school Tzu Chi volunteers: from incoming high school freshmen to graduating high school seniors. Of course, 
            many of the group leaders, curriculum team, and other attendees may also be Tzu Ching, Tzu Ching Alumni, Tzu Chi volunteers, etc.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>What can I expect from the conference?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
            The main theme for this year's conference will be Mission of Medicine. Many of our classes and activities will incorporate this theme.<br/><br/>
            
            As with past conferences, this year's conference will also focus on promoting team-building and leadership. 
            A major part of the conference will be you working with your group on a hands-on, service-learning project to implement in your local chapters.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Should I wear my uniform?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
            Although you have the unique opportunity to attend the TCYA Leadership Conference within the comfort of your own home, during the event 
            we still encourage you to wear your Tzu Shao uniform rather than your pajamas.
