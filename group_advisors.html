            <p><span class="label">How I joined Tzu Chi: </span>I was introduced to Tzu Chi when I was in 3rd grade with Tzu Chi Chinese Academy, but it wasn't until 7th grade when I started volunteering with Tzu Chi. I joined because I wanted to positively impact and help the undeserved individuals and families within my communities. One of my favorite events I've volunteered at is at a senior center in San Diego. Being able to turn a frown into smile on the grandmas and grandpas who are facing illnesses is a wonderful feeling, and I am forever grateful for people like Roger Chou and Cyrus Shen for inviting me to join UC San Diego Tzu Ching.</p>
            <p><span class="label">Hobbies: </span>I love playing basketball, working out, and cooking! If you don't see me reading a personal development or finance book, you'll usually see me trying out a new workout! I also love spending time with my two older brothers and snacking on Kettle popped jalapeno chips!</p>
