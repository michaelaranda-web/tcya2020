I joined because I wanted to positively impact and help the undeserved individuals and families within my communities. One of my favorite events I've volunteered at is at a senior center in San Diego. Being able to turn a frown into smile on the grandmas and grandpas who are facing illnesses is a wonderful feeling, and I am forever grateful for people like Roger Chou and Cyrus Shen for inviting me to join UC San Diego Tzu Ching.</p>
